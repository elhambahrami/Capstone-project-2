Conclusion:
	After trying models like, Logisticregression, RandomForest, and GradientBoosting, the performance of Logisticregression is the best. 94 percent accuracy.
	And the ranking feature shows that, the consuming time for each incident, response time and the facilities of departments are important factors to determine safety of a neighborhood, therefore in order to improve the safety, fire departments should address their needs like more trucks, engines to make their response time faster, also they should be in cooperate to city consults and municipal authorities in order to improve the traffic and roads in order to make shorter the response time of the incident.
We may need more data like the season, temperature of incident time to make a better model and conclusion but based on what I was working on, I would conclude having more fire department with more facility in unsafe zip codes and improving roads for fire trucks to make them a faster response can be important matters that consult cities should pay attention to.
